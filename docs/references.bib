	abstract = {Advances in multi-omics have led to an explosion of multimodal datasets to address questions from basic biology to translation. While these data provide novel opportunities for discovery, they also pose management and analysis challenges, thus motivating the development of tailored computational solutions. Here, we present a data standard and an analysis framework for multi-omics, MUON, designed to organise, analyse, visualise, and exchange multimodal data. MUON stores multimodal data in an efficient yet flexible and interoperable data structure. MUON enables a versatile range of analyses, from data preprocessing to flexible multi-omics alignment.},
